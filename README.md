The elements and characters used in the game are from 'Super Mario Bros,' but the game's design is totally different from it. Mario must pass through the blockers by pressing specific arrow keys. 
The objective is to break the highest scores by passing through as many blockers as possible within a limited time. (15 seconds)

Blockers:
Yellow Star: UP arrow key
Mushroom: DOWN arrow key
Turtle: RIGHT arrow key

-The game ends when the timer reaches zero. 
-When Mario passes through a blocker, the player earns one point. The scores will be recorded and output to encourage players to break their own highest scores.
-When Mario successfully passes through 6 blockers continually, an extra 2 seconds may be added to the timer.
-Blockers are static , Mario is animate, but all these will remain their own coordinate. IT IS NOT A COLLISION GAME
