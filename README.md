There is no online tutorial for this such game. 

The elements and characters used in the game are from 'Super Mario Bros,' but the game's design is totally different from it. Mario must pass through the blockers by pressing specific arrow keys. 
The objective is to break the highest scores by passing through as many blockers as possible within 20 seconds.

Blockers:
Yellow Star: UP arrow key / key w
Mushroom: DOWN arrow key / key s
Turtle: RIGHT arrow key / key d

- The game ends when the timer reaches zero. 
- Pass through a blocker, the player gets one score.
- Pass through 5 blockers continually, an extra 2 seconds may be added to the timer.
- Press wrong key, the timer will minus 2 seconds to prevent player press randomly between the keys.
- We will save the highest scores by using file. After the players restart the game still can know their highest score.
