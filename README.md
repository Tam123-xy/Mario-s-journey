This game is inspired by Pou mini game 'Pet walk'.

Fortunately, there is no online tutorial for this such game, so it is quite challenging for us and we did it :)

The elements and characters used in the game are from 'Super Mario Bros,' but the game's design is totally different from it. Mario must pass through the blockers by pressing specific arrow keys. 
The objective is to break the highest scores by passing through as many blockers as possible within 15 seconds.

Blockers:
Yellow Star: UP arrow key
Mushroom: DOWN arrow key
Turtle: RIGHT arrow key

- The game ends when the timer reaches zero. 
- Pass through a blocker, the player gets one score. The scores will be recorded and output to encourage players to break their own highest score.
- Pass through 5 blockers continually, an extra 2 seconds may be added to the timer.
- Press wrong key, the timer will minus 2 seconds to prevent player press randomly between the keys.
- Blockers are static , Mario is animate, but all these will remain their own coordinate. IT IS NOT A COLLISION GAME
- We will save the highest scores by using file. After the players restart the game still can know their previous height score.
